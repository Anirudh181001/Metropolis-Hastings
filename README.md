# Metropolis-Hastings
As part of the simulation of Restricted Boltzman Machines, I had coded out the Monte Carlo Markov Chain Metropolis Hastings algorithm in order to generate a suitable list of electronic configuration to work with for the rest of the RBM. This was done as part of my Physics Honours Course during my undergraduate in SUTD.
